**spacemax-theme** is a fork of spacemacs-theme by Nasser Alshammari. That theme 
is an Emacs colour theme that started as a theme for 
[spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs). Like spacemacs-theme, 
spacemax-theme comes with dark and light variants and it should work well with 
256-colour terminals.
